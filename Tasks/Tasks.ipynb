    "<p>Tasks are the core units in Beewant, representing individual data instances that require annotations. Whether you're working on image classification, object detection, or text sentiment analysis, tasks encapsulate the data that needs to be labeled. Annotations, on the other hand, are the labels and metadata that you add to these tasks. They provide valuable insights that train and fine-tune machine learning models.</p>\n",

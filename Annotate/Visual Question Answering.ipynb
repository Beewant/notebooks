    "In order to prepare the data from the JSON file to fit the format required by the platform, several transformations were applied:\n",

    "### Constructing Annotation Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Identification**: The `image` key in each JSON object serves as the identifier for the image associated with the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversations Parsing**: Each JSON object contains a list of conversations. Assuming the first two elements of this list represent a question and its corresponding answer, they are extracted and used for annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Annotation Object Creation**: For each task, a structured annotation object is constructed. This object consists of two parts: annotations and task data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Annotations**: Each annotation includes information about the type (e.g., textarea), the text value (e.g., question or answer), and its origin (e.g., manual). Annotations are organized into a list, with each question-answer pair represented as a separate annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Task Data**: This part contains the data associated with the task. In this case, it includes the image data encoded in base64 format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Image Handling**:\n",
    "    - **Image Identification**: The image name is extracted from the `image` key of each JSON object.\n",
    "    - **File Path Construction**: A file path is constructed using the extracted image name and the directory where the images are stored.\n",
    "    - **Image Existence Check**: The script checks if the image file exists in the specified directory. If not, the task associated with the image is skipped.\n",
    "    - **Image Encoding**: If the image file exists, it is read and encoded in base64 format. The image format is inferred from the file extension.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Processing File:\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON file is processed by iterating through its contents and extracting relevant information for each task. Tasks are constructed based on this information, and only valid tasks (i.e., those with existing images) are included in the final list of task annotation objects."

    "\n",

    "  - `endpoint`: The URL endpoint of the project to retrieve tasks from.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Returns:**\n",

    "1. **Send GET Request:**\n",
    "   - This function sends a GET request to the specified `endpoint` to retrieve project tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract Task Information:**\n",
    "   - If the response status code is `200` (indicating success), the function extracts task IDs and image URLs from the response JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract Filename:**\n",
    "   - For each task, it extracts the filename from the image URL using the `os.path.basename` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build Dictionary:**\n",
    "   - It constructs a dictionary with task IDs as keys and their corresponding filenames as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling:**\n",
    "   - If the request fails (status code other than `200`), an error message is printed indicating the failure to retrieve project tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return Dictionary:**\n",
